# Turn and flop

`StreetGame` is a heads-up no-limit tree on a 4-card turn or a 3-card flop. It uses `CfrTrainer` unchanged. `RiverGame` is still the one-street river. There is no hand bucketing and no RNG.

Chance deals an ordered hand pair from the joint distribution on the starting board, then the players bet. When the street ends without a fold, the next card is dealt uniformly from the cards that are not on the board and not in either hand. A turn tree deals the river. A flop tree deals the turn and then the river. A fold ends the hand. Chips already invested stay in the pot, and the next street starts with no bet to call.

Player 0 is out of position and acts first on every street. Utilities use the same net-chip rule as the river: `pot / 2` is the dead money each player already posted, and investments on these streets are added on top. Uncalled chips are not extra profit.

An information set is the acting player's own hand, the cards already dealt, and the public action line. It does not contain the opponent's hand. A turn decision is one node, shared by every river that can follow it.

Bet sizes are the same pot fractions on every street. The pot they multiply grows after each call. Raise sizes, when omitted on the command line, copy that player's bet sizes. At most eight actions are legal at one decision. A tree with more than 200,000 terminals is rejected.

## Checked values

On `Ah Kd 7c 4s`, queens versus jacks, check-only, the solver's value matches an independent average over the 44 rivers. The Nash gap is 0. Two in-position hands that share the out-of-position hand share that player's turn information set and, on a river card in neither hand, the river information set as well.

On `Kh Kd 7c 4s`, `AhAd` versus `2c3d` wins every river. Check-down is worth +50. With one pot-sized all-in and no raises, CFR+ at 400 iterations reached 50.0016209123 with Nash gap 0.00187032418952. The gap at 20 iterations was 0.714285714286.

On the flop `Ah Kd 7c`, queens versus jacks, check-only, the value matches the average over all 1,980 turn-and-river runouts: 41.6161616162. The gap is 0.

## Command line

```sh
street_solver
street_solver --board Ah,Kd,7c --oop-range QcQd --ip-range JcJd --no-all-in --max-raises 0 --iterations 1 --algorithm vanilla
```

The default is the turn lock above. The reported Nash gap is NashConv, not NashConv/2.
